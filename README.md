Approach for this Project:The project aimed to predict the likelihood of heart strokes using machine learning models. The dataset was loaded and explored to gain insights into the data, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling. Three models were developed: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM architecture. Each model was trained and evaluated based on accuracy.
